## Hi there 👋
I’m Aman  an aspiring AI Engineer focused on understanding and building intelligent systems. I care about how things work under the hood, not just using tools but truly engineering AI solutions with clarity and depth.

 # I’m currently focused on:

Building a strong foundation in AI Engineering
Understanding LLMs, ML systems, and AI workflows in detail
Using this chat as a dedicated space for AI engineering questions, deep dives, and structured learning
Gradually moving from concepts → implementations → real-world applications
This README (and this chat) reflects an ongoing learning + building journey.

# My current and intended tool stack includes

# Programming & ML
Python
NumPy, Pandas
PyTorch / TensorFlow (learning & usage phase)

# AI / LLM Ecosystem
Large Language Models (LLMs)
Prompt engineering & model reasoning
AI system design concepts

# Workflow & Learning
Git & GitHub
Jupyter / notebooks
ChatGPT (as a technical thinking partner)
